## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.10+)
- npm or yarn
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized setup)

### Installation and Setup

<details>
<summary><b>📱 Frontend Setup</b></summary>

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend development server at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>⚙️ Backend Setup</b></summary>

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐳 Docker Setup (Recommended)</b></summary>

For the easiest setup experience, use Docker Compose:

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build

# Or run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
1. Build and start the frontend container (accessible at `http://localhost:3000`)
2. Build and start the backend container (accessible at `http://localhost:8000`)
3. Configure networking between the services

To stop the services:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

You can also use a `.env` file in the project root to store your environment variables:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```
</details>

### Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose | Required |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Authentication for OpenAI API | Yes |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | For GitHub integration features | No |
